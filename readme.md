Welcome to Bookr's Landing and Team page.

Below is the pitch provided for this project:

    Pitch: Bookr is your source for all things Text Book. Picture the AirBNB of text books, a social platform for peer reviewed text books. 

    MVP: As a user I can log in, and see a list of text books. Each book will have a 5 star rating I can browse from. As a user I can review each book. 
    Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to a home page.
    Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
    Home Page - Contains a list of Books laid out in a grid format.
    Single Book Page - Loads information about the book, Author, Name, Publisher and a scrolling list of reviews. Add review and delete book buttons present.
    Single Book Add Review Page - Clicking add review brings up a form (could be modal, could be its own page) where a user can add their review of the book. Clicking submit adds the review to the books information.
    Delete Book - Modal confirming the action, on confirmation user is routed back to the home page and book is gone from the list of books. 
    Data Modeling: Each book has a Title - String, Author - String, Publisher - String and Reviews- Array of Objects field. The reviews object shape should be Reviewer - String, Review - String. 


    Stretch Goal: A link to each book will take me to a site where I can purchase a book and compare prices.

Command needed for this file: `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`

My folders are laid out so that the html pages are in the top.
All less files without a component JS are in the less folder.
This compiles back to the index.css file in the css folder.

Assets includes all images for this project, with an inner folder specifically for the Team page cards.
